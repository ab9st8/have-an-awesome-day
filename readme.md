## The "Have an Awesome Day" Public-Domain-Equivalent License Extension 

The Have an Awesome Day is an extension for any public-domain-equivalent license, which allows licensers to inform users about some desires regarding the usage of their code.

### Rationale

Have an Awesome Day provides the licenser with a way to express encouragement for the end user to adhere to a specific **set of guidelines** when using the codebase being licensed, which can result in both the licenser's and the user's days being more awesome.

The purpose of using Have an Awesome Day is to make licensing software with public-domain-equivalent licenses more **humane** by simplifying the concept of expectations when using and modifying FOSS code.

I encourage you to use Have an Awesome Day if you care about improvements to your code being shared or about attributions to your person being made when your code is redistributed. HAD doesn't bind the user (or the developer for that matter) legally in any way, so they still can not share the improvements they made or not attribute you when redistributing your code, but it brings **humanity** to the equation of public-domain software. Sometimes a simple "please" is all a person needs.

### Usage
**The HAD is intended for use with public-domain-equivalent licenses only, like the Unlicense, WTFPL, CC0, BOLA, or 0BSD.**

To use Have an Awesome Day in your codebase, simply copy the [have-an-awesome-day.md](./have-an-awesome-day.md) file to the directory where your public-domain-equivalent license is located.

This does not bring **any** legal implications upon either the user or you, the developer, because it does not feature any terms, agreements, or binding vocabulary. The legal state of the codebase is exactly the same with the HAD  as it is without.

### The text
Have an Awesome Day is roughly made up of two parts, an introduction (paragraphs 1-3) and an etiquette (paragraphs 4-5).

The introduction:
1. informs the reader that the codebase they're browsing is licensed under a public-domain-equivalent license,
2. explains what such a license is and what implications using it brings,
3. encourages the reader to adhere to the etiquette if they're planning on modifying, redistributing or republishing the code.

The etiquette consists of three points, each being a humble request in the event of modification, redistribution or republication of the code. There is not much to explain about these points, because each is described in detail in the text itself.

### Questions you might have
*Does including the HAD in my project bring any legal liability upon me, you, or the user? Is it safe?* **It's 100% safe! I'm not a lawyer, not even close, but from what I understand, there is nothing in the  that could even remotely bind anyone legally in any way. The HAD is simply a list of favors that anyone can as easily fulfill as they can reject or even ignore.**

*Can I modify the HAD? What is the HAD licensed under?* **Yes, you can modify the HAD however you want! The HAD is licensed under the Unlicense + the HAD itself.**

*If I use the HAD, do I have to change any SPDX license identifiers in package files, e.g. in "package.json", "project.nimble" or "Cargo.toml" files?* **No, because the HAD is "invisible". It has no effect by itself. Whichever license you're using stays the same.**
